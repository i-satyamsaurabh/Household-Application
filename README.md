## üåü Project Overview

**Household Services Hub** is a full-stack web application designed to bridge the gap between customers seeking household help and professionals offering their services. Built as a part of the **Modern Application Development I (MAD1)** course at IIT, Madras, this project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of database modeling, back-end development, and front-end design. The application supports three distinct user roles‚Äî**Admin**, **Professional**, and **Customer**‚Äîeach with a dedicated dashboard and functionalities tailored to their needs.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

This project leverages a modern, lightweight technology stack for efficient development and deployment.

| Component           | Technology                               |
| :------------------ | :--------------------------------------- |
| **Backend Framework** | Flask                                    |
| **Database** | SQLite                                   |
| **ORM** | Flask-SQLAlchemy                         |
| **Templating Engine** | Jinja2                                   |
| **Frontend** | HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5                 |
| **Database Design** | ERAlchemy                                |

---

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture inspired by the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.

-   **Model:** The data layer is managed by **SQLAlchemy**, defining the database schema for Users, Services, Requests, etc. The Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram was designed using **ERAlchemy**.
-   **View:** The presentation layer is handled by **Jinja2 templates**, rendered with dynamic data from the backend. **Bootstrap** ensures a responsive UI that works across all devices.
-   **Controller:** **Flask** acts as the controller, handling HTTP requests, processing business logic, interacting with the database, and rendering the appropriate templates.

### Database Schema
